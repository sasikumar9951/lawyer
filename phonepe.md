Node.js SDK Installation

The PhonePe PG Backend SDK for Node.js is designed to simplify the process of integrating PhonePe’s payment solutions into your backend systems. It provides a structured, pre-built interface for securely interacting with PhonePe’s payment infrastructure.

This SDK helps you build a reliable and PCI-compliant payment flow with minimal effort. Ideal for server-side environments, it ensures robust communication between your application backend and the PhonePe Payment Gateway.

Minimum Supported Version
Node.js: v14 or higher
Install the SDK using npm
Use the following command to install the SDK in your Node.js project:

Command to Install

npm i https://phonepe.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/phonepe-pg-sdk-node/releases/v2/phonepe-pg-sdk-node.tgz
This command will install the SDK from the specified repository.

What’s Next?
Now that you’ve added the Node.js SDK to your project, the next step is to initialize the required classes.

Head over to the Class Initialization section to learn how to set it up properly.

Node.js Class Initialization

StandardCheckoutClient class will be used to communicate with the PhonePe APIs. You can initiate the instance of this class only once.
Use required credentials while initializing the object.

Parameter Name	Data Type	Mandatory
(Yes/No)	Description
client_id	Integer	Yes	Your unique client ID for secure communication with PhonePe.
client_version	String	Yes	Client version for secure communication with PhonePe.
client_secret	Integrer	Yes	Secret key provided by PhonePe Payment Gateway, which must be securely stored.
env	Enum	Yes	Environment for the client:
• PRODUCTION
• SANDBOX
Sample code

import { StandardCheckoutClient, Env } from 'pg-sdk-node';
 
const clientId = "<clientId>";
const clientSecret = "<clientSecret>";
const clientVersion = <clientVersion>;  //insert your client version here
const env = Env.SANDBOX;      //change to Env.PRODUCTION when you go live
 
const client = StandardCheckoutClient.getInstance(clientId, clientSecret, clientVersion, env);
What’s Next?
Now that you’ve learned how to initialize the StandardCheckoutClient with your credentials to connect securely with PhonePe APIs. Next, you’ll create a payment request to start the transaction and generate the payment link for users.

Head over to Initiate Payment to learn how to start the transcation.

Initiate Payment with Node.js SDK

The Initiate Payment step allows you to start a payment transaction by creating a payment request with essential details like order ID, amount, and redirect URL. This request prepares the transaction on PhonePe’s platform and generates a redirect URL where users complete their payment securely.

Request
Use StandardCheckoutPayRequest.build_request() to create the payment request. Below are the key attributes you can set:

Parameter Name	Data Type	Mandatory
(Yes/No)	Description	Constraints
merchantOrderId	String	Yes	Unique order ID assigned by you	Max length: 63 characters, no special characters except “_” and “-”
amount	Long	Yes	Order amount in paisa	Minimum value: 100 (in paisa)
metaInfo	Object	No	Meta information is defined by you to store additional information. The same data will be returned in status and callback response.	
metaInfo.udf1-5	String	No	Optional details you can add for more information.	Maximum length = 256 characters 
redirectUrl	String	No	URL to which the user will be redirected after the payment (success or failure)	
Sample Request

import { StandardCheckoutClient, Env, MetaInfo, StandardCheckoutPayRequest } from 'pg-sdk-node';
import { randomUUID } from 'crypto';
 
const clientId = "<clientId>";
const clientSecret = "<clientSecret>";
const clientVersion = <clientVersion>;    //insert your client version here
const env = Env.SANDBOX;        //change to Env.PRODUCTION when you go live
 
const client = StandardCheckoutClient.getInstance(clientId, clientSecret, clientVersion, env);
 
const merchantOrderId = randomUUID();
const amount = 100;
const redirectUrl = "https://www.merchant.com/redirect";
const metaInfo = MetaInfo.builder()
                    .udf1("udf1")
                    .udf2("udf2")
                    .build();
 
const request = StandardCheckoutPayRequest.builder()
        .merchantOrderId(merchantOrderId)
        .amount(amount)
        .redirectUrl(redirectUrl)
        .metaInfo(metaInfo)
        .build();
 
client.pay(request).then((response)=> {
    const checkoutPageUrl = response.redirectUrl;
})
Response
The function returns a StandardCheckoutPayResponse object with the following properties:

Attribute	Data Type	Description
state	String	State of the order created, expected value is PENDING.
redirect_url	String	URL for the PhonePe Payment Gateway Standard Checkout page. This is the URL to which the user should be redirected for payment.

What’s Next?
After using the pay method to initiate a payment via the PhonePe PG, you can create a payment request and start the payment process. The next step is to create the order SDK.

Proceed to the next section to learn how to Create Order SDK .
Create Order with Node.js SDK

Create SDK Order is to generate an order token when your backend is in Node.js and you’re integrating with any mobile app. This lets your frontend app get the Order token it needs to start the payment requests.

Request
You can use CreateSdkOrderRequest.StandardCheckoutBuilder() to create the request. You can pass the following attributes.

Parameter Name	Data Type	Mandatory
(Yes/No)	Description	Constraints
merchantOrderId	String	Yes	Unique order ID assigned by you.	Max Length = 63 characters
amount	Integer	Yes	Order amount in paisa.	Minimum value: 100 (in paisa)
redirectUrl	String	Yes	URL to which the user will be redirected after the payment (success or failure).

const env = Env.SANDBOX;      //change to Env.PRODUCTION when you go live
 
const client = StandardCheckoutClient.getInstance(clientId, clientSecret, clientVersion, env);
 
const merchantOrderId = randomUUID();
const amount = 1000;
const redirectUrl = "https://redirectUrl.com";
 
const request = CreateSdkOrderRequest.StandardCheckoutBuilder()
        .merchantOrderId(merchantOrderId)
        .amount(amount)
        .redirectUrl(redirectUrl)
        .build();
 
client.createSdkOrder(request).then((response) => {
    const token = response.token
})
